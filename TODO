High Priority:
- CREATE integration tests (POST)
- UPDATE integration tests (PATCH)
- REPLACE integration tests (PUT)
- DELETE integration tests (DELETE)

- Add model validation (beforeCreate/beforeSave user validator, error mesasges, Unit tests, integration tests)
- Add event listeners (http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#events.application-listener)
- Add request validation (is this given to me?)
- Add Swagger
- Populate README

Low Priority:
- Separate internal IDS from external REST endpoint??
- Consolidate checks/reports (checkStyle, Jacoco, PMD, Findbugs) into single index page
- Add CPD
- Make reports look nicer
- Fail build on less than 100% code coverage
